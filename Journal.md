# Day 1: 6th Jun Friday
*Hours spent: 3h 30min*
Was getting fustrated on my iPad for not having a decent keyboard (am on a Logitech Slim Folio Pro currently) and wanted something better so decided to take part in Highway to make a keyboard my huge hands can use

Started by watching this [Wonderful tutorial by ScottoKeebs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WXpGTIbxlQ&t=1052s) on how to get started and learnt a bit about KiCAD

Followed his tutorial and messed around a bit more to understand the idea of a macropad

Did some research and decided on this layout! Connects to the iPad via a Pi Pico using Type C (planning on using my own Orpheus Pico to connect it) and created a rough schematic

Decided on the keyswitches to be the Kailh Choc v1 for not being too loud that I can't use it in a classroom but slim enough that I can make it into a way for me to store my iPad.

I so wasn't expecting this to be insanely easy?? HOW IS A KEYBOARD THIS EASY?? (i think imma rage when it comes to figuring out the QMK stuff for this keyboard and working with Shapr3d but that should be probably fine on my iPad)

Was planning on using the Choc v1 switches for lower profiles however choose to use universal Choc v1/v2 ports on my keyboard so I can switch anytime and also be able to use MX keycaps

First row be takin 3 centuries vrooo ðŸ˜­

HOW DID I NOT KNOW THAT SELECTING A PART IN A SCHEMATIC SELECTS IT IN THE PCB EDITOR THAT IS GOATED YOOOOOO

KiCAD Snapping feels weird (that's why dropping keys in takes sooooo long)

## Reasons why I didn't want a macropad
1. Kinda useless (for someone who is on iPad all the time, would rather have to use a keyboard shortcut I'm familiar with)
2. I can develop a case around this!

3hours and 3 minutes of learning KiCad and making my own custom keyboard and fiddling around with different sizing, here is the final design (haven't even but in the diodes yet :sob:)
